## Hi there 👋
---
I'm Tarun 👋

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer and a passionate C++ programmer who loves solving problems and building meaningful, functional projects. My journey began with C++ and DSA, and that strong foundation has shaped the way I think, code, and approach challenges.

Right now, I’m actively learning full stack development while consistently sharpening my DSA skills in C++. I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and improving a little every single day. My focus is on writing clean logic, building real-world projects, and growing into a confident software developer.
