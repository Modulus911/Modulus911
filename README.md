# Hi there, I'm Tarun 👋

I'm an aspiring **Full Stack Developer** and a passionate **C++ programmer** who loves solving problems and building meaningful projects.  
My journey started with C++ and Data Structures, and that foundation has shaped the way I think, code, and approach challenges.

Right now, I’m learning **full-stack development** while sharpening my **DSA skills in C++**.  
I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and improving a little every single day.
